### `Purpose`

The `purpose` of this app is to help `song writers` and `producers`.

The `genre page` is for producers to learn general information about a certain genre in order to make somethings similar. Spotify playlists are implemented to be able to hear each genre and get a feel for it.

The `lyrics page` is to help brainstorm lyrics. It can give you questions to help you think or rhyming or descriptive words. You can then save the lyrics you've thought of to your account.
